### Project Description
- The coronavirus has decimated the travel industry, and Airbnb, the home rental company that appeared unstoppable not so long ago, has not been spared.

- The goal of this project was to identify the key aspects that make an Airbnb listing sucessful and pinpoint recommendable strategies to put in place during and after the Covid19 pandemic.

- The workflow consisted of an extensive exploratory data analysis of listings in Barcelona and the construction of a machine learning model capable of predicting the most recommendable price.

- Given the nature of the dataset used, this analysis aims to outline some possible  actionable suggestions through descriptive analytics of Barcelona's Airbnb landscape.

- The commands assume an intermediate understanding of the Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn libraries.

### Data
- For the purpose of this analysis, the [dataset](https://wiki.montera34.com/airbnb/datos/barcelona) used contains about 20K  Airbnb listings in the city of Barcelona and 96 variables regarding its specific charactheristics and amenities.

Columns:

### Hypothesis
- [The most recent trends](https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/may-13-its-time-to-start-looking-ahead-192) suggests tourists will want more affordable options, will have a desire for private spaces and that cleanliness will be more important than ever.
